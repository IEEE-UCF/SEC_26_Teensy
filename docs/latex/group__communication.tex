\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Handles Fly\+Sky IBUS remote control input. This class initializes and manages communication with a Fly\+Sky receiver via the IBUS protocol. It reads channel data, scales it, and provides access to these values. It also includes functionality for failsafe behavior if a specific channel indicates a signal loss or specific state. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
