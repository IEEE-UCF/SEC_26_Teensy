Manages a sequence of waypoints for robot navigation. This class allows for adding waypoints, executing a path defined by these waypoints, handling timeouts, and checking if waypoints have been reached. It interacts with a \doxylink{class_vector_robot_drive_p_i_d}{Vector\+Robot\+Drive\+PID} object to control the robot\textquotesingle{}s movement and to get its current pose.

bool Path\+Handler\+::execute\+Path (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{}{}\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Executes the waypoint-\/based path navigation step by step. This function is intended to be called repeatedly (e.\+g., in a main loop). It checks if the current path is empty. If not, it sets the current waypoint as the target for the robot\textquotesingle{}s drive system.

If a waypoint is reached, it initiates a pause (MINTIMEPAUSE) before advancing to the next waypoint. If a timeout occurs, it logs a message and advances to the next waypoint. 

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
True if all waypoints in the path have been successfully reached (i.\+e., current\+Path\+Index is beyond the end of the path). False if the path is still being executed or is empty.
