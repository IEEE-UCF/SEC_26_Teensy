\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Manages a sequence of waypoints for robot navigation. This class allows for adding waypoints, executing a path defined by these waypoints, handling timeouts, and checking if waypoints have been reached. It interacts with a \doxylink{class_vector_robot_drive_p_i_d}{Vector\+Robot\+Drive\+PID} object to control the robot\textquotesingle{}s movement and to get its current pose. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
